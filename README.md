Facebook Logon and Like
=======================

It was hard to find the concise version of this when I went hunting through the Facebook API, so this page documents everything you need to include the Like and Logon buttons on your site, along with some customizations to make.

This uses the JS SDK from facebook.

I also needed to track when a user "Liked" an event, so a call is made to a function when that event occurs.
